Email simulation:
During development we can use an emulated email server that Python provides.
In the terminal (and inside our virtualenv) we run:

$ python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:8025

To use the above server, we set the following environment variables.
$ export MAIL_SERVER=localhost
export MAIL_PORT = 8025

Running the following script sets up this emulated MAIL_SERVER
$ ./emulate_email.sh
(This should be done in a separate terminal tab.)

Using gmail as our email server:
$ export MAIL_SERVER=smtp.googlemail.com
$ export MAIL_PORT=587
$ export MAIL_USE_TLS = 1
$ export MAIL_USERNAME=<your-gmail-username>
$ export MAIL_PASSWORD=<your-gmail-password>

We'll have to allow our gmail account to be used by 'less secure' apps if we
go this route.
The above solution worked. However, trying to do the export statements with a bash script
fails. So I had to run the export statements above manually in the firstwebapp directory.
